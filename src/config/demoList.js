    NOTE: "Amazing, incredible, flabbergasting... Good, the tone has been set (I've tried this one before but never wrote any proper tasting note). Colour: amber. Nose: don't you love it when very old spirits converge? Frankly this could as well be (a great) rum or (a great) cognac. Time erases differences and brings the best to light, provided the wood knew how to behave. Which is obviously the case here. Stunning 'beehive-y' notes at first, then sublime camphory ones, then many earths, many herbs, and both a little umami and a little osmazome. So this wonderful, ever-subtle meatiness that does not really display any proper notes of meat. See what I mean? There are myriads of other aromas but you'd rather call the Anti-Maltoporn Brigade NOW... Mouth: starts with tiny fruits and the jams and liqueurs made thereof. Which is pretty unusual in a 50 yo whisky! Such as wild strawberries, white currants, probably a little cassis... Very impressive. Quite some resin too, which is not unheard of in old spirits (actually it was in the nose too), then tobaccos and various oils and waxes. Beeswax is very prominent, as it was on the nose. Some sappy honeys, old chardonnays of Montrachet-quality, a little gum Arabic... Oh and peaches, nectarines, apricots, and even a touch of salt. Good, I think I hear the Anti-Maltoporn Brigade in the yard... Quick... Finish: not eternal but fresh, not woody although rather resinous indeed, with an unexpected freshness in the aftertaste. Beeswax and a curious feeling of very old bourbon. Really! Old spirits do converge indeed... Comments: I would have liked to share this one with Colin Ross. Actually, maybe I did while at Whisky Live Paris back when it came out, but I am not sure it was this one. Let's officially state it was. ",

Let's not push our luck... With water: little sugar eggs and Havana Club, English breakfast tea, banana cream... Well I wouldn't say there's much Ben-Nevisness in this one, this is almost a lightish middle-aged Speysider on the nose. Mouth (neat): ... while we tremble... Right its very sweet and almost sugary, with some bubblegum here and there and a fattish oiliness. A little lemon curd. With water: rather a little better, with more green tea and less straight sugary fruitiness, but it really is a very light, almost thin Ben Nevis in my opinion, although it would tend to improve with breathing. Finish: medium, sweet. This feeling of young calvados once again. A little coconut wine in the aftertaste, I suppose that's the barrel. Comments: I'm having trouble with these ones, must be me as some friends rather love the parcel. I suppose one cannot change his own nature. That 1991 by SigV over this one, anytime! ",

Well careful, this one goes down faster than Franz Klammer (apologies to younger generations) as it's very clean and fruity.

With water: little changes. Perhaps more chalk? More wool? Mouth (neat): extremely, and I mean extremely good. Extremely old-school, and even kind of a blend of Ardbeg with Macallan -who's never tried that? Very leafy and leathery too, that's the harder side of it. With water: no, we're fine. Good smoked honeyed and raisiny cake, with a growing smokiness and even ashes. Finish: long, salty, tobacco-y, raisiny. It's been done goodly, as they used to say at the White House. Only the aftertaste would be a little green and tannic. Comments: very good, but it's to be wondered if oloroso and Ben Nevis do not generate peat when married together. Molecules gone wild, perhaps?

One day someone will have to try to make inorganic liqueurs, but that's another story... With water: pretty perfecto. Top notch mineral distillate, knowing that minerality is saving wine, and will save whisky as well sooner or later. Yeah I know, distillation... Finish: long, kind of clean, chalky, almost perfect.

Superb structure, not a much talked-about concept in whisky but I say that's got to change! Mouth (neat): I think this is perfect. Menthol and lemon curd, chalk, ginger and turmeric, green spices... Now it is really too strong and just wouldn't unleash its full potential yet. Well, theoretically... With H2O: vanquishes you, as they say at Aston Martin's. In truth it would rather get softer, but these bitter tones just work. Grasses, teas, even vegetables (artichokes) and a feeling of ashes and coal. This is truly Ben Nevis, pretty uncompromising and just uncommercial. F**k commerce, we're in it for arts and culture, we are not vandals! Finish: long. Mandarins and bitters, forgot to mention mandarins and bitters. Salty and peaty aftertaste. Comments: glorious.

Mouth: I just hate it when a session starts too fast and high. I know, I should have chosen a Zinfandel finish instead, but who would kill a Nevis in Zin?

Nose: straight, high-precision mineral and lemony arrival, unfolding on many chalks and clays, limes and citrons, granny smith, new wool, fresh almonds and hazelnuts, spitzenklasse riesling, plus a little soot and a little metal polish. How very Ben Nevis. Mouth: this is where it takes off. Amazing nut cakes, barley water, camphor, cough drops, chalk, a curious combination of pistachio and liquorice that works very well, pink grapefruits, fir honey, and just a faint touch of vanilla. Forgot to mention mullein syrup, which is excellent for yourBen Nevis part two (still for Colin Ross) bronchial tubes. Sorry we don't do prescriptions. Finish: rather long, with a perfect balance and a slightly floral side that's a little unusual. Comments: totally excellent.

With water: wool and chalk, some other typical markers. Mouth (neat): terrific, gentler than the 1997 and with many more tropical fruits, somehow ala Bowmore. Passion fruit tarte and wee pink bananas, plus quinces and peaches. You could say a very good Pinot Gris. In the background, naturally, waxes, citrus and minerals. With water: gets a tad grassier, with a little more paraffin and linseed oil. Touches of salt too. Finish: medium, extremely complex, with just everything we've mentioned before. Comments: it's great to compare 1996 with 1997, both from great refill. If you believe in vintages, naturally. Isn't 1996 fruitier and a little softer and gentler, generally speaking? ",

This one should be cellared for around twenty years. I know that's the harder part. Finish: medium, on all-vitamin fruit juice, chalk, and always these wee almondy and sooty notes.

So this one's less 'immediately immaculate' (well done S.) but this nose that's globally on cigars works very well too. Indeed, old-school Ben Nevis. With water: gets much gentler, almost cake-y. Quite some mead.

So a whole different game, and indeed rather the style of some earlier official bottlings. With water: the distillate manages to float within all this sweet sherried goodness.

Finish: rather long rather fattish. Aftertaste on game, beef stock and umami sauce. The sherry speaking out. Comments: no dead mice in this very good one, I'm almost disappointed (understand that if you can).

Mouth: it's really cool that they would have bottled these at 45%. What's sure is that liquorice and bonbons are running the show now, with clearly some syrup or liqueurs in the background. Were these sauced-up at that time? Some mild disappointment, shall we say. Finish: no, falls apart, gets even more sugary, I'd almost say sacchariny, while the aftertaste's rather bitter and burnt.

A huge loaf of wholegrain bread, with caraway, fennel seeds, pumpkin seeds, hazelnuts, pistachios perhaps, and possibly some carrot added to the dough. Love love love these whiffs of orange and elderberry blossom that are rising to your nostrils after a while. Mouth: probably no textbook-whisky, but I find this extremely good. I find this very 'old-Europe', whatever that means, with many herbs and seeds, as if this was made by a skilful old apothecary. Also, these big, obvious notes of peach liqueur are just incredible (given that they've probably not added any peaches to the wash). Superb palate. Finish: are we sure no one's added any peaches?

Many breads, including fruit breads, really a lot of banana-y flavours, candyfloss, marshmallows, all that without an ounce of vulgarity. Plus big notes of honeysuckle and elderberry syrup. Extremely seductive, aromatic, yet not too extravagant. With water: totally new-generation-good. Jelly babies, cakes, breads, very soft spices, faint fermentary notes. Mouth (neat): wow. I cannot not think of some Chichibus. Thick and creamy fruitiness with some orange blossom water and various crystallised citrus. A whole family pack of artisanal fruit jellies, really. Never give me a pack, I'd wolf them all down before Chopin's minute waltz is over. With water: I'd say quinces, greengages, and apricots. Talking about those fruit jellies. Finish: medium, very fruity. Some leafier wood appearing in the aftertaste, as if it was saying 'I was there too!' Comments: modern-school whisky, rather perfectly made.

Would then rather gear towards regular cappuccino and glazed chestnuts, as well as bouillon, dried porcini or Caesar's mushrooms. Unusual and intriguing so far. With water: mushrooms ruling the show, including morels and truffles. Also cured ham and more tobacco, leather, ground turmeric, ginseng powder... Mouth (neat): bites you a wee bit, with loads of bitters, dried mushrooms again, leather, and this feeling of sucking your cigar while you reach its end (as I remember that). Includes ashes. Very tight, almost paprika-y at times. With water: cold broth full of ham, chives, parsley, mushrooms, coffee... Finish: long, still tight and ultra-dry, with some bitter chocolate and even more salty bouillon. Comments: fun stuff. Some friends wouldn't kill for this style, but in this very case, as far as I'm concerned and since I love mushrooms, I think it worked. Forgot to mention green walnuts. ",

Indeed this is just another higher-echelon Pouilly-Fum&eacute; made whisky, what we could even call a 'pur sang'. Stunning lemons and grapefruits, angelica, coriander leaves, dill, seawater, kelp, chalk and flints, then perhaps not-too-ripe mangos and just the tiniest signs of grated coconut, and fresh marzipan. All elegance. Mouth: oh very good. You could say proper old refill HP. Some smoke and some resinous and almondy herbs, the better side of glue-y flavours, more marzipan, something reminiscent of fresh putty, or orgeat syrup, pistachio syrup (just had some right this morning, I'm serious), pear cake, and really a salty peatiness. I'd swear you feel time, not wood. Finish: not too long but sublimely almondy, with this salty and frankly coastal background. Touches of peat and lime in the aftertaste. Comments: love these ones.

Let's keep in mind that these batches, whichever the bottlers  I suppose it's a 1978  have sometimes been a little sketchy. The whisky loch, remember... Colour: white wine. Nose: certainly not the easiest batches indeed, with a lot of carboard, paraffin, even plastics, then damp flours, acidic dough, and just today's edition of the WSJ. That's right, paper and ink. All hopes are on my dear, faithful Vittel. That's water... With water: got to love Vittel, since H2O literally transforms this old Bunnahabhain. Perfect citrusy and herbal notes, with various vegetal oils singing in unison in the back. The choir, you know. Almost a christic transfiguration (hold your horses, S.) Gets perfect after you've let it breathe for a few more minutes, getting rather wonderfully medicinal. Mouth (neat): ah, wait, no quibbles here, despite these wee touches of varnish and paraffin. Nice limes and lemons, kiwi juice, a little riesling, then mint tea and a little olive oil. And green bananas. Unusually green given that it is 40 years old. What's sure is that this palate's much, much, and I mean much nicer than the nose when water was not added yet. With water: careful, do not add too much, it would become a little too green and rather drying and cardboardy. Well don't add any. Finish: medium, rather on green tea. Comments: I would say this one is to be had with water on your nose, and naked on your palate. I know, I know... Very good score for these vintages. ",

Now the sherry's pretty gamey, with some cured ham, leather, balsamico, and what we sometimes call 'civet' in the wine world. With water: a whole beef bouillon, with notes of teriyaki, coriander, chocolate sauce, then tar and new rubber (tyres). More and more tar. Mouth (neat): extremely syrupy, extremely bittersweet, leathery and earthy, with some dry chocolate, more gamey flavours, tarry liquorice Dutch-style... With water: water works extremely well on the one, bringing out many small herbs and spices, loads of pipe tobacco, more liquorice, more tar... But also this inherent lightness, which comes a surprise. At +/-40%, it becomes pretty refreshing. Finish: long, on some kind of salty chocolate and liquorice combo that works well.

Nose: barley and vanilla, maize bread, hay, and good beer. With water: yeasty bread. Nice. Mouth: good sweet apple juice, nougat, barley, touch of malt extract. Rather rougher than the others but this is both younger and done before the inception of 'total wood technology domination'. With water: no, it is creamier and sweeter. Barley water, triple sec, maple syrup, vanilla fudge. Finish: same with some herbal touches. Comments: it was very good 'already', back in 2012. For the sake of research. ",

Nose: so a very early distillate, and still some roughness here and there, despite the many years. Roasted peanuts, molasses, malt, butterscotch, drops of soy sauce, balsamico, tobacco... Well if that's a hogshead, it's a sherry hogshead. With water: ale and fig chutney, perhaps. Old white wine. Mouth (neat): very creamy, on malt and kirsch, with a discrete soapy side, cologne, chocolate, cinnamon rolls... Well, there is some kind of imprecision to this one, but remember Arran only started burning in 1995 indeed. I remember very vividly the first drops we could try, we were all thinking, 'but why aren't they going for peated?' Another era... With water: these touches of soap do not quite belong here. Finish: medium, with a little cardboard and chestnut pur&eacute;e. Comments: perhaps more a prototype cask? In any case, it's just impressive that they would have improved and perfected their outputs this much. Anecdotal bottle. ",

Amoroso is a fairly light-cream-like blend of dry and naturally sweet sherry (PX, Moscatel) that seems to be pretty much out of fashion these days. Just not in Talisker. Colour: gold. Nose: I've always had the feeling that Diageo took it easy with this amoroso thing, keeping the influence to very civilised proportions. Indeed, it is this salty, briny smoke that first comes out, while some mustardy, slightly curry-like sweet notes would rather appear after a good twenty seconds. Make that two. Then walnuts and tobacco, for good measure. Impeccable. Mouth: very good. We call this 'sauce &agrave; la diable'. Simmered mustard with honey and cream, more or less. Notes of leather, green walnuts, rather burnt raisins, Maggi sauce, and naturally, 'peat'. Finish: long, very salty now. This is Talisker, no doubt. The trademark pepper in the aftertaste. Comments: the sweeter Talisker that's never been that 'dulce'. I've always liked Talisker al natural better, but would never refuse a dram or two of DE. ",

    NOTE: "There should be some story to be found about this mysterious 'Xpedition', let me first check that out... Right, correct, this baby was finished in casks that included wooden staves that had traversed the Atlantic, from the Spanish Canary islands to Antigua, on the deck of adventurer James Aiken's yacht. Just ten casks have been subsequently made and then blended away. Well, as they say, 'they really did something' here, it's not just a tribute bottling straight from Wikipedia. Like, a tribute to Cristopher Columbus or to Vasco de Gama. Or Magellan. Let's try it... Colour: gold. Shows restraint. Nose: oh! The story was nice, really, but the juice is splendid, or so it seems this far. You'll find these creamy touches of bergamot and citron jam, perhaps even yuzu, with luminous notes of forest herbs, heather, moss in the morning, lemongrass, Thai basil, then oysters and their wee buddies the winkles, a little beeswax and quince jelly, plus probably some fresh kelp . This is all very complex, extremely elegant, and superbly fresh. I believe we ran out of laudatory adjectives. Mouth: no straight oak in the way (not even floated wood, ha-ha), rather zests, crystallised citrus, a few drops of Spanish Chartreuse (Spain, again), and this salty-resinous combination that often comes out of some pretty old, well, Taliskers. The freshness here is really impressive, its balance as well, not to mention the complexity and the body... Wonderful tension at 43 years. Finish: finishes are always superb in old Taliskers, really. When the salt, the softer peppers, the citrus, the brine and all elements from the sea are singing the chorus in unison. Whale songs. Comments: back to pedestrian considerations, I understand why they wouldn't have loaded the whisky itself aboard that yacht. Well, I for one would have quaffed it all during the crossing! That's right, ten casks. ",

What's sure is that this is the oldest Arran I've ever tasted. Colour: copper/amber. Nose: starts with a bowl of sour cherries and a clear vinosity, on old barriques and a little balsamico. I'm also finding many red berries, which come totally unexpected, raspberries, mulberries, also rosehip, dried pears, whiffs of dunnage, blood oranges, drops of fino... This is not what I was expecting, on the other hand I think it worked, it's just, well, very singular, with obvious wine impact. Mouth: cherry clafoutis, once again, cherries in kirsch, then mead and triple-sec, elderberry syrup, and a feeling of arrak. Then more blood oranges, more eglantine tea, and just preserved morellos. Are we sure this has never met with a single dollop of pinot noir? Finish: medium, with a little more malt and raisins, caf&eacute; latte, butterscotch... I short, it fell in line.

Whiffs of honeysuckle too, maybe cider. With water: barley and cakes, that's what we were coming for. No obvious vinosity, for example it is much less vinous than the 25.

Uncomplicated and good. With water: believe me or not, I cannot not think of Yamazaki. Is it serious, doctor? Finish: medium and rather all on barley and mirabelles.

Nutshell, this is clearly more complex and fresher. With water: flours, breads, doughs, grist... That's just what the people want. Mouth (neat): perfect.

Quite some lime juice too, this is surprisingly deep given that it's just unfiltered vodka (S.!) You would almost believe its malt whisky.
